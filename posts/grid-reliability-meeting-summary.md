- Chris Ekoh discussed the strategy for avoiding load shedding by focusing on avoiding a 'watch' trigger, which is a precursor to Energy Emergency Alerts (EEA).
- Current operations aim to prevent grid loading close to 3000 megawatts, at which point EEAs and ancillary services are triggered.
- IMM modeling suggests that reducing the procurement of ancillary services can allow the grid to run effectively.
- Concerns were raised about potential overbuilding of transmission infrastructure if the NPRR 1180 is passed, which could lead to unnecessary costs.
- Overbuilding risk is high due to a provision allowing utility officers to request infrastructure based on forecasted load needs.
- Chris Ekoh emphasized the importance of balancing reliability and affordability of the grid, noting the necessity of evaluating cost implications before implementation.
- He highlighted the high cost of some ERCOT programs, such as ECRS, which was more expensive than initially anticipated.

#### Senator Zaffirini for Jeff McDonald, Understanding 4CP and Its Impact on Utility Bills

- Mr. McDonald provided a high-level overview of 4CP, a technique used in transmission cost allocation.
- 4CP was first applied in 1966 for transmission allocation based on coincident peak load driving the need for new transmission.
- Current transmission investments are driven by factors other than peak load, such as demographic shifts, industrial use, and new resources.
- Costs of transmission are currently allocated broadly across Texas ratepayers, which may not be efficient.
- Exploring a more localized cost allocation to avoid broad distribution of costs across all Texans.
- Discussion on expanding coincident peak measures to 12 times per year or from 15 minutes to one hour.
- Increasing the time from 15 minutes to an hour might reduce inefficiency and difficulty predicting peak periods.
- Acknowledgment that 40% of utility bills are tied to transmission costs, with an expectation for this percentage to grow.
- No specific forecast was provided for the future percentage of transmission costs on utility bills.
