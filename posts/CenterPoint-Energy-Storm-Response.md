    * Jason Ryan on CenterPoint’s temporary emergency generation assets
        * Jason Ryan provided context about the temporary emergency generation assets installed to mitigate risks post-Winter Storm Uri and subsequent legislation in 2021 and 2023.
        * Large units primarily address the risk of load shedding, which disproportionately affects residential and small commercial customers in Houston due to the presence of large industrial consumers.
        * Houston requires importing 60% of its power due to insufficient local generation; large units help mitigate risks posed by potential disruptions in transmission lines (e.g., due to natural disasters).
        * These assets are seen as tools for various risks, with the necessity of maintaining a diverse and adequate fleet to handle different scenarios.
        * CenterPoint commits to better transparency and communication about risk assessments and the size of their fleet through periodic filings and possibly independent assessments.
        * There is ongoing evaluation of the affordability of these assets, with discussions on extending recovery periods to lower customer bills and re-assessing the need for these assets as new energy fund generators come online.
        * Open to discussing whether CenterPoint should continue mitigating these risks or if these responsibilities should be relocated.
        * CenterPoint intends to file periodic updates and engage in further discussions about the assets and their associated costs.
    * Jason Ryan on their filing under Project 56793
        * Filed 250 pages of information in response to Miss Corona’s five questions.
        * Most of the information pertains to leases of assets, specifically 232 pages for question one including short term and long term leases.
        * Short term leases initiated in 2021 due to immediate needs during hurricane season and following Winter Storm Uri.
        * Long term leases extend to 2029 with various amendments to ensure asset availability and vendor compliance.
        * Smaller units leased following legislative amendments in 2023.
        * Details and responses about units used, costs, and performance are provided in spreadsheets starting on page 233.
        * No units owned by the company, all under lease as per law.
        * Information on mutual assistance units received during Hurricane Beryl provided (pages 241).
        * Incremental costs associated with unit usage during Hurricane Beryl are partially detailed, awaiting final invoices (page 243).
        * Narrative on deployment process of assets during Hurricane Beryl provided (pages 245-250), including operational hours.
    * Eric Easton on CenterPoint’s circuit segmentation
        * CenterPoint has made major changes in circuit segmentation and intelligent grid switching to improve load management.
        * During Winter Storm Uri, manual attempts to segment circuits were made but were hindered by road conditions.
        * Installation of intelligent grid switching devices has added approximately 400 MW of capacity for load rotation.
        * An upcoming circuit segmentation study for ERCOT aims to install around 40 more devices for further enhancement.
        * Current manual load rotation capability is about 3000 MW, leaving a 2000 MW deficit during Winter Storm Uri.
        * Post-Uri improvements include investments in distribution systems, weatherization, dual fuel capability, and overall winter reliability and resiliency.
        * There will be a re-analysis this year based on a new 19,000 MW benchmark.
        * Load ratio share changes yearly and large industrial loads may come on faster than before, adding uncertainty.
        * Calculations also consider factors like potential increases in wildfire risks, which could impact load shedding in the Houston area.
        * Ongoing evaluations are being made on the number of units needed and deployment speed, which may require process and staffing changes.
        * Past analyses will be provided to compare with current data to understand decision-making progress.
        * Evaluation criteria also include considerations for loss of major transmission lines into Houston in load shed analyses.
    * Commissioner Hjaltman’s question to CenterPoint on stackable generators
        * Commissioner Hjaltman asks CenterPoint if purchased generators for load shed can be replaced with smaller stackable generators.
        * CenterPoint indicates that 5MW units can be paralleled at a substation.
        * Each 32MW unit is connected at its own substation and is ready for use in various scenarios.
        * Paralleling 1 MW units is not feasible due to physical space constraints at substations.
        * 5 MW units are compared to tractor trailers, while 32MW units require cranes for assembly.
    * Commissioner Glotfelty’s question on canceling lease agreements
        * Commissioner Glotfelty had questions about the termination clause in Amendment 5 of a lease agreement.
        * Two different financial consequences were noted: a potential $53 million payment and 25% of total cost ($125 million).
        * Clarification sought on the consequences of canceling the leases today.
        * Termination provision expired in March 2023 and extended till the end of 2023.
        * No live provision exists that allows termination based on the prudence determination; it was contingent on a commission determination not being appealed.
        * Only remaining termination option stems from vendor non-performance, which includes failure to provide 94% availability.
        * Commissioner Hjaltman inquired about the possibility of changing out various units for better performance.
        * It was confirmed that while the assets are tested and maintained for readiness, changing the assets requires mutual commercial agreement with the vendor.
    * Eric Easton on CenterPoint readying units
        * Eric Easton described performance evaluations, including testing and deployment during Hurricane Beryl, affirming that proper procedures are in place for readiness.
        * Discussion on readying units which progressed to EEA level, addressing the potential need for load shed.
        * Confirmation that units were readied four times since the Uri event.
        * Consideration of future scenarios including Texas Energy Fund generation impacting asset management.
        * Acknowledgment of changes in load ratio share due to industrial and residential growth.

        * If power is on and unable to communicate with the meter, data is estimated at a 15-minute interval level.
        * If power is off, usage is not estimated, and zeros are recorded for those intervals.
        * Transmittal of data involves sending information to ERCOT and retail electric providers.
        * In July, 2.9 million transmittals of meter usage data were sent.
        * 96,000 of these contained some form of estimation.
        * 74,000 meter reads showed a 30% lower usage compared to the prior year.
        * Received 1300 meter dispute requests from retail providers.
        * 16 requests resulted in reversed and rebilled charges.
    * Connie Corona’s question for CenterPoint concerning the modification of their standard operating procedure
        * There were anomalies in customer usage data where usage was higher than expected, even when customers were out of service.
        * CenterPoint uses a model that examines customer usage over the past three months to create exceptions and verify billing usage.
        * They are actively fine-tuning this model to improve its accuracy and address anomalies, especially those caused by storms.
        * Communication with customers about these issues was discussed, and representatives were asked how they handle customer interactions regarding unusual bills.
    * Christina Rollins, NRG’s Assistant General Counsel of Reg. Affairs on communication with customer
        * Christina Rollins explained the process of TDUs sending usage data to reps/lses.
        * Customers can view their daily usage on the Smart Meter Texas (SMT) portal and via weekly summary emails.
        * During Hurricane Beryl, customers noticed usage data even when their power was out.
        * NRG contacted TDUs (notably Centerpoint) to resolve the issue; it took about a week, resolved by July 29.
        * An 867 transaction is used for monthly meter reads, and if estimates are used, it’s indicated on the bill.
        * NRG prepared call center agents to explain the usage discrepancy to customers and inform them they wouldn’t be charged for power outage periods.
        * Information about the issue was also updated on the online account maintenance portal and included in weekly summary emails.
        * During the crisis, call center wait times were less than a minute, with a peak call volume of 44,000 calls in one day.
        * Past instances of estimated meter readings during crises, such as Hurricane Uri, were also noted.
