</ul>
<h4>Woody Rickerson, SVP and COO, ERCOT, Invited Testimony</h4>
<ul>
<li>ERCOT&#39;s forecasting models have been updated to include TSP load forecasts, with a significant increase to 150 gigawatts by 2030 due to House Bill 5066.</li>
<li>The Regional Transmission Plan considers upgrading from 345-kV to 765-kV due to unprecedented load growth, similar to a historical upgrade in the 1960s.</li>
<li>The Permian Basin Reliability study also explores transmission upgrades with 345-kV and 765-kV options included in ERCOT&#39;s overall plan, with decisions expected from PUC in May.</li>
<li>Large load growth is occurring with 63 gigawatts tracked, 6.3 gigawatts approved to energize, and 3.6 gigawatts energized, posing unique challenges for grid stability.</li>
<li>Battery and solar energy account for 83% of new generation interconnection, with a total of 371 gigawatts in the queue, alongside 26 gigawatts of gas-fired projects.</li>
<li>ERCOT&#39;s system weatherization and reliability efforts, including 3,000 inspections since winter storm Uri, are recognized as leading initiatives by the NERC winter reliability assessment for 2024.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Panel 1 Q&amp;A</h3>
<h4>Senator Schwertner to Connie Corona, PUC&#39;s Plan for Mobile Generation Misuse</h4>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on PUC&#39;s investigation of hurricane Beryl and preparedness, focusing on mobile generation misuses.</li>
<li>Recommendation for utilities to pre-identify site characteristics requiring backup generation.</li>
<li>Suggestion for utilities to measure needed mobile generation in advance for efficient deployment during storms.</li>
<li>Inquiry about potential reimbursement plans for ratepayers who paid for unused or misappropriately sized mobile generation.</li>
<li>Mention of legislation filed for making ratepayers whole and possible redeployment of unused units to San Antonio.</li>
<li>References to legislation proposed by Senator King and others regarding ratepayer protection.</li>
<li>Acknowledgment of the need for balancing new wind and solar generation to maintain grid reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Schwertner to Woody Rickerson, Impact of Co-Located Generation on Grid Stability</h4>
<ul>
<li>The growth of large load requires an additional 150 gigawatts by 2030, raising concerns about grid stability.</li>
<li>Co-located generation and large loads raise policy issues, especially regarding transmission cost allocation.</li>
<li>Even if load is behind a generator, it still consumes the same amount of power, posing questions about its impact on the grid.</li>
<li>There is a challenge in outage coordination with co-located large loads since ERCOT loses some control when it becomes a private use network.</li>
<li>The main issue is transmission cost allocation, socialized across all rate payers, not accounting for loads behind the meter.</li>
<li>4CP cost allocation method doesn&#39;t consider behind-the-meter loads, impacting ERCOT&#39;s accounting perspective.</li>
<li>Transmission system stress has shifted due to solar power, making traditional peak hours obsolete.</li>
<li>A review of the cost allocation method is needed due to changes in resource mix, with stress occurring more often outside traditional peak hours.</li>
<li>The Market Analysis Division agrees with recommendations from the independent market monitor to revisit transmission allocation policy in 2025.</li>
<li>No initial fees are currently imposed on large loads when they plan to add to the grid.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Representative Hunter to Connie Corona, Transparency in Utility Bill Charges</h4>
<ul>
<li>Highlighted public&#39;s concern about undefined charges on utility bills labeled as &#39;miscellaneous&#39;, &#39;delivery&#39;, and &#39;other&#39;.</li>
<li>Requested Connie Corona and her agency to investigate these charges for transparency before the legislative session.</li>
<li>Emphasized the need for public awareness about why charges are applied.</li>
<li>Connie Corona agreed to review and update the committee on utility billing charges &amp; welcomed requests from committee members on specific bills needing investigation.</li>
<li>Rep. Hernandez Discussed the legislative appropriations request for more resources due to increased caseloads, especially regarding transmission line processing.</li>
<li>Chairman inquired into penalties for utility service quality during major outages.</li>
<li>Discussed inclusion of major events in existing penalty measures for service interruptions.</li>
<li>Senator Zaffirini discussed codifying customer rights to information about service restoration times and emergency contact with providers.</li>
<li>Explored potential methods for customers to report vegetation hazards, suggesting phone lines and tech-friendly solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Zaffirini to Connie Corona, Emergency Communication Plans for Utilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Importance of utilities conducting annual emergency drills involving neighboring utilities and local governments.</li>
<li>Recommendation for pre-emergency communication plans to be required by the legislature or PUC.</li>
<li>Need for dedicated communication paths and shared plans among partner entities during emergencies.</li>
<li>Most generation and transmission facilities met the weatherization inspection requirements, with a few exceptions rectified for winter or summer seasons.</li>
<li>Lessons from international use of 765 equipment include efficient land use and existing U.S. supply chain.</li>
<li>Efforts to increase public awareness of ERCOT&#39;s website and mobile app through expanded social media presence.</li>
<li>Lack of prepared metrics to demonstrate improved public usage of the website and app; intention to provide them upon request.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Nichols to Woody Rickerson, Power Allocation for Data Centers with Dedicated Generation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of the growth in power consumption, driven by data centers.</li>
<li>Some data centers are contracting for their own power generation.</li>
<li>Two scenarios for supplying power to data centers: co-located behind the generator or via the grid.</li>
<li>Behind-the-meter generation is subtracted from grid capacity, not adding load to the grid.</li>
<li>Generation contracted through the grid keeps the generation apparent in reports but can be misleading about availability.</li>
<li>Concerns about potential congestion in transmission lines and cost allocation.</li>
<li>Emphasis on the need for improved separation of resources used off-grid and their impact on grid capacity.</li>
<li>Data centers&#39; power draw can be calculated during peak hours using shift factors and 4CP method.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Schwertner to Woody Rickerson, TDU Projection Models and Uniformity</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current methodology for projecting load can be manipulated, prompting discussions on improving this system.</li>
<li>Issues with 4CP reductions are noted during the critical months from July to September.</li>
<li>TDUs use different projection models, highlighting concerns about their accuracy and the lack of uniformity.</li>
<li>A voluntary large load interconnection process is in place for reviewing loads reported by TSPs.</li>
<li>Duplications of loads within Texas have been detected and removed, but global duplications remain challenging to address.</li>
<li>No fees are required for foreign loads during interconnection, pending TSPs&#39; input.</li>
<li>Concerns exist over the artificial scarcity introduced by current grid management methodologies affecting ancillary services.</li>
<li>There was an improvement due to process changes in ERCOT&#39;s management for summer 2023 and further updates are planned for next year.</li>
<li>Discussions on large load connections and their impact on the grid show concerns over cost burden on ratepayers without universal benefits.</li>
<li>Currently, there is no ability to differentially manage or curtail large loads connected to the grid.</li>
<li>A voluntary registration program exists only for crypto mines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Representative Hunter to Connie Corona, Simplifying Electric Bill Transparency for Consumers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Representative Hunter expressed concern about electric bill charges being passed to consumers without clear explanations.</li>
<li>ERCOT has made efforts to educate consumers by providing resources on social media, but Hunter feels this indicates complexity in understanding bills.</li>
<li>Hunter suggested many consumers, especially those less technologically savvy, might struggle with accessing online resources for bill explanations.</li>
<li>The primary concern discussed was the burden of costs and lack of transparency in passing costs to Texans.</li>
<li>There was a discussion about the absence of a &#39;no harm&#39; certification in Texas to ensure that new projects do not reduce grid megawatts or negatively affect grid function.</li>
<li>Corona acknowledged the potential benefit of a &#39;no harm&#39; certification policy for Texas and mentioned a possible legislative solution for data centers to switch to backup power during grid scarcity.</li>
<li>It was clarified that ERCOT and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) look at projects from a transmission adequacy standpoint, but Texas lacks a generation adequacy or resource adequacy standard.</li>
<li>The panel transitioned to include speakers from the Office of Public Utility Council and Potomac Economics to discuss related regulatory and economic issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Panel 2 Invited Testimony</h3>
<h4>Chris Ekoh, Deputy Public Counsel, OPUC</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chris Ekoh introduced himself and mentioned the governor&#39;s new public council appointment.</li>
<li>Clarified a question regarding the cost of ancillary services, mentioning an estimated $12 billion excess cost for ECRS implementation.</li>
<li>OPUC&#39;s annual public meeting scheduled for December 12th was announced.</li>
<li>Discussion focused on the rising costs of ancillary services, as dictated by the 87th legislature, with an emphasis on balancing reliability and cost.</li>
<li>Cost of ancillary services rose by 270% between 2020 and 2022 due to increased conservative procurement post-Winter Storm Uri.</li>
<li>In 2023, costs increased by 32.4% despite decreases in natural gas and energy prices, attributed to the implementation of ECRS.</li>
<li>IMM suggested that current ECRS levels could be reduced by 52% and non-spin quantities by 35% without compromising reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Jeff McDonald, Director, Potomac Economics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Jeff McDonald, representing IMM for ERCOT and Potomac Economics, discussed reliability focus in Texas.</li>
<li>Texas utilizes a market-based approach to reliability, aiming to provide price signals that encourage performance and new investment.</li>
<li>McDonald has been in his role for nine months and offers a fresh perspective on reliability issues.</li>
<li>Emphasis on two reliability approaches: enhanced resiliency and development of market reliability products.</li>

<li>Involvement in developing a new product (DORS) to address forecast timing gaps.</li>
<li>Worked on improving shortage reserve curves for the upcoming real-time co-optimization market framework for next year.</li>
<li>Goal is to align procurement and pricing of reliability services with their value to Texans.</li>
<li>Extended focus over the past two years on these market instruments for increased reliability.</li>
<li>Positive outcomes from the ECRS process, with ERCOT now better positioned to avoid false scarcity conditions.</li>
<li>Identified potential for reduced procurement of reserves and lower costs for consumers, working with ERCOT to further reduce these procurements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Panel 2 Q&amp;A</h3>
<h4>Senator Schwertner to Chris Ekoh, Cost Allocation for Non-Residential Load Growth</h4>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on overprocurement and reserves impacting Texas electricity costs, noting adjustments post-Winter Storm Uri to maintain affordability.</li>
<li>Focus on non-residential load growth driven by data centers, crypto mining, oil and gas, and new commercial operations.</li>
<li>Concerns about resource adequacy, interconnection, cost allocation, and cost causation in ERCOT and PUC programs.</li>
<li>Mention of House Bill 5066 and NPRR1180, related to substantiated load definitions and visibility in load forecasts.</li>
<li>Emphasis on the need for accurate load forecasting and potential overforecasting risks leading to overinvestment.</li>
<li>Concerns raised about lack of standardization in methodologies used by TDUs for load forecasting.</li>
<li>Discussion on possible financial commitments for large loads before grid connection to address phantom load issues.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Zaffirini to Chris Ekoh, Strategies to Prevent Load Shedding</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chris Ekoh discussed the strategy for avoiding load shedding by focusing on avoiding a &#39;watch&#39; trigger, which is a precursor to Energy Emergency Alerts (EEA).</li>
<li>Current operations aim to prevent grid loading close to 3000 megawatts, at which point EEAs and ancillary services are triggered.</li>
<li>IMM modeling suggests that reducing the procurement of ancillary services can allow the grid to run effectively.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about potential overbuilding of transmission infrastructure if the NPRR 1180 is passed, which could lead to unnecessary costs.</li>
<li>Overbuilding risk is high due to a provision allowing utility officers to request infrastructure based on forecasted load needs.</li>
<li>Chris Ekoh emphasized the importance of balancing reliability and affordability of the grid, noting the necessity of evaluating cost implications before implementation.</li>
<li>He highlighted the high cost of some ERCOT programs, such as ECRS, which was more expensive than initially anticipated.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Zaffirini for Jeff McDonald, Understanding 4CP and Its Impact on Utility Bills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mr. McDonald provided a high-level overview of 4CP, a technique used in transmission cost allocation.</li>
<li>4CP was first applied in 1966 for transmission allocation based on coincident peak load driving the need for new transmission.</li>
<li>Current transmission investments are driven by factors other than peak load, such as demographic shifts, industrial use, and new resources.</li>
<li>Costs of transmission are currently allocated broadly across Texas ratepayers, which may not be efficient.</li>
<li>Exploring a more localized cost allocation to avoid broad distribution of costs across all Texans.</li>
<li>Discussion on expanding coincident peak measures to 12 times per year or from 15 minutes to one hour.</li>
<li>Increasing the time from 15 minutes to an hour might reduce inefficiency and difficulty predicting peak periods.</li>
<li>Acknowledgment that 40% of utility bills are tied to transmission costs, with an expectation for this percentage to grow.</li>
<li>No specific forecast was provided for the future percentage of transmission costs on utility bills.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Panel 3 Invited Testimony</h3>

<li>She supports mandating communication plans by statute or rule.</li>
<li>Believes the Commission should have statutory authority for these plans.</li>
<li>Would support clarification or codification if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senator Zaffirini to Katie Coleman, Expanding on Net Peak Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on the difference between absolute maximum demand and net peak load, with net peak load affected by low renewable output.</li>
<li>Transmission planning now considers net peak load more than absolute peak demand.</li>
<li>Congestion-related projects are often geographically constrained, exemplified by Houston&#39;s electricity import needs due to strict emissions restrictions and water constraints.</li>
<li>Cost allocation in transmission, such as the postage stamp allocation, aims to avoid disadvantaging economically significant areas like Houston.</li>

<h4>Senator Schwertner to Walt Baum, Position on No Harm Certification for Co-Located Generation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on the position regarding no harm certification for co-located generation with large load.</li>
<li>Senator Schwertner asked about any negative effects on overall grid reliability or net loss of dispatchable generation due to co-located generation.</li>
<li>No firm position was stated; concerns about maintaining Texas&#39;s image as open for business were noted.</li>
<li>Mention of the importance of establishing standards for new load requirements.</li>
<li>Acknowledgement that determining these standards falls within the appropriate jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5 – Public Testimony</h2>
<h3>Glenn Lyons Public Testimony</h3>
<ul>
<li>Glenn Lyons, an ExxonMobil retiree, spoke about challenges faced by the ERCOT committee.</li>
<li>Lyons noted that ERCOT&#39;s market design assumed all key parameters were known, leading to issues with adapting to new parameters.</li>
<li>Compared to more flexible markets, the electricity sector&#39;s slow adaptation is problematic, especially with rapid changes such as the rise of data centers.</li>
<li>Lyons proposed Consumer Regulated Electricity (CRE) as a solution for rapid growth issues, particularly for data centers.</li>
<li>CRE utilities could operate independently from the regulated grid, offering faster adaptation without adding costs or reliability concerns to existing grids.</li>
<li>This proposed model would not require Public Utility Commission (PUC) oversight, allowing for quicker implementation.</li>
<li>Lyons provided a written testimony, a one-page introduction to CRE, and a draft bill concerning this idea.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Brent Bennett Public Testimony</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brent Bennett from the Texas Public Policy Foundation addressed the committee.</li>
<li>Emphasized the economic future of Texas depends on meeting reliability expectations at the lowest cost.</li>
<li>Highlighted two critical points from House Bill 1500, Section 23.</li>
<li>Discussed the PUC report on transmission and backup power costs for dispatchable and non-dispatchable generators.</li>
<li>Emphasized the importance of cost allocation for ancillary services not currently addressed, as mandated by Senate Bill 3.</li>
<li>Mentioned market price volatility increases with the addition of wind and solar energy.</li>
<li>Current research indicates a billion-dollar impact on consumers in 2023 due to wind and solar.</li>
<li>Discussed market issues caused by the single market clearing price not accounting for wind and solar variability.</li>
<li>Exacerbation of market problems due to federal subsidies for wind and solar.</li>
<li>Reliability standards per HB1500, Section 23 point towards solutions, but firming must apply to all generators.</li>
<li>Concern that applying firming only to new generation won&#39;t address existing 40 gigawatt wind and solar by 2026.</li>
<li>Studying economically efficient ways to use firming to benefit ratepayers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ryan Scott Public Testimony</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ryan Scott represented Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA), established in 2005 for advocating sensible energy policies for families and businesses.</li>
<li>CEA advocates for affordable, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy policies benefiting Texans.</li>
<li>They have a network of 400 member companies and 500,000 individuals nationwide.</li>
<li>Emphasized balance between traditional and renewable energy sources to meet diverse consumer needs.</li>
<li>Urged the committee to focus on affordability, reliability, and environmental stewardship in energy policy implementation.</li>
<li>Critiqued the grid&#39;s reliability post-Winter Storm Uri and other natural disasters, highlighting its impact on the Texas economy.</li>

<li>Larry Lindenschmidt introduced himself as the Executive Director of the Hill Country Institute and a volunteer with the Citizens Climate Lobby.</li>
<li>He emphasized the importance of considering extreme weather events, based on a report by the Texas State Climatologist, for grid reliability in Texas.</li>
<li>Thomas Patock from Texas State University provided insights into climate change and its human-driven impacts on weather events.</li>
<li>Highlighted risks include drought, wildfires, tornadoes, derechos, floods, hurricanes, and associated damages.</li>
<li>Stressed the importance of integrating climate science into grid planning to prevent costly long-term infrastructure rebuilding.</li>
<li>Advocated for funding $2 million to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) for a climate action plan.</li>
<li>Recommended building more transmission lines and ensuring they are built to withstand extreme weather specific to their locations.</li>
<li>Public testimony was closed after Mr. Lindenschmidt&#39;s presentation, and members expressed appreciation for the discussion.</li>
