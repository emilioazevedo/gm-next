14:T2c10,<h2>NOGRR245 Update – Slides</h2>
<h3>1 – Background of NOGRR245 - ERCOT Staff</h3>
<ul>
<li>ERCOT filed the original NOGRR on January 11, 2023, following NERC recommendations due to IBR failures during system disturbances.</li>
<li>IEEE 2800 was approved on February 8, 2023, leading to the NOGRR being tabled and referred to various working groups.</li>
<li>Between February and September 2023, multiple comments were filed by market participants and others.</li>
<li>On 9/14/2023, ROS granted NOGRR urgent status and recommended approval with amendments.</li>
<li>TAC tabled the NOGRR on September 27, 2023, and more comments were filed until March 2024.</li>
<li>On 3/27/2024 and 6/7/2024, TAC voted for recommending the NOGRR with various amendments from different groups.</li>
<li>Leading to 6/17/2024, joint commenters filed opposition to the TAC recommended version, threatening to appeal if approved.</li>
<li>ERCOT requested to table the NOGRR until August to address concerns of joint commenters.</li>
<li>ERCOT board tabled NOGRR245 on June 18, 2024, based on ERCOT’s request.</li>
<li>Since then, ERCOT staff worked on revisions with joint commenters to retain near-term benefits and bifurcate exemption processes.</li>
<li>Revisions aimed to clarify or obtain JC agreement, remove redundancy, correct errors, and respond to joint commenters’ concerns.</li>
<li>ERCOT plans to recommend making the subsequent bifurcation of NOGRR a board priority to be effective by April 1, 2025 to coincide with the deadline for submitting exemption requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2 – Basis of changes to TAC recommended version – ERCOT Staff – Clarification/JC Concern</h3>
<p>Changes made to the TAC recommended version of NOGRR245:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key changes include clarification that output reductions due to wind speed or solar irradiance changes are exempt from penalties during ride-through events.</li>
<li>Frequency ride-through and voltage ride-through requirements were updated.</li>
<li>Added requirement for resources to inform ERCOT on maximized ride-through capability for modeling.</li>
<li>Clarified deadlines for completing modifications and related notifications.</li>
<li>Added clarity on compliance during the fault and recovery periods.</li>
<li>Increased transparency on reporting resource maximization status to ERCOT.</li>
<li>Clarification on the exemptions or extensions for meeting new requirements and reporting responsibilities.</li>
<li>Modified information requirements for frequency and voltage ride-through capability reports.</li>
<li>Resource entities must explain efforts to verify technical limitations if unable to get OEM or consultant verification.</li>
<li>Stated that ERCOT will protect confidential information submitted in reports.</li>
<li>Specified requirements for timely submission of extension requests by April 1, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.1 – Basis of changes to TAC recommended version - ERCOT Staff – Bifurcation</h4>
<p>Movement to the bifurcation bucket for changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes made to accommodate moving exemption process criteria to a new NOGRR.<ul>
<li><strong>Section 2.6.2.1(7):</strong> Resources must submit frequency ride through capability report and request exemptions by 4/1/25. Criteria for granting exemptions will be established in the new NOGRR.</li>
<li><strong>Section 2.12.1(1):</strong> Existing facilities not meeting ride through requirements must request an extension or exemption by 4/1/25. Criteria for exemptions to be determined in subsequent NOGRR.</li>
<li><strong>Section 2.12.1(2):</strong> Exemption requests can only be supplemented with additional information under the new NOGRR process. No new exemption requests allowed after 4/1/25.</li>
<li><strong>Section 2.12.1.3:</strong> Removed exemption from the title; now applies only to extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Sections 2.12.1.3(3),(4), and (5):</strong> Removed references to exemptions, addressed in new NOGRR.</li>
<li><strong>Sections 2.12.1.4(6) and (7):</strong> Removed references to exemptions, addressed in new NOGRR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.2 – Basis of changes to TAC recommended version - ERCOT Staff – Corrections</h4>
<p>Bucket three corrections involved errors in the version approved by TAC:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2.9.1.1(1)</strong> contained typographical errors in formulas in tables A and B.</li>
<li><strong>2.9.1.1(8)</strong>, renumbered, corrected paragraph numbers due to a deletion and requires entities to complete maximization by 12/31.</li>
<li><strong>2.9.1.2(7)</strong> was renumbered to accommodate changes.</li>
<li><strong>2.12.1(1)</strong> corrected section references.</li>
<li><strong>2.12.1.4</strong> had its title removed and subsections were renumbered as part of 2.12.1.3.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.3 – Basis of changes to TAC recommended version - ERCOT Staff – Redundancies</h4>
<p>Removal of redundant or duplicative requirements in Operating Guide sections 2.9.1.1 and 2.12.1, focusing on avoiding duplication with IEEE 2800 standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Table C in 2.9.1.1(1)</li>
<li>Revision and deletion of sections related to initial frequency and voltage ride-through capability reports to avoid redundancy and address objectionable language.</li>
<li>Shift in focus to discuss next steps and address questions/concerns</li>
<li>Upcoming discussions on August 19th in the R&amp;M Committee regarding NOGRR245 and presentation of RFI results in line with NERC recommendations.</li>
<li>Board’s consideration of NOGRR245 on August 20th, aiming for approval and subsequent filing of a new NOGRR to develop exemption criteria by April 1st of next year.</li>
<li>Explanation of the process and timeline for compliance with new requirements, including potential TAC workshops to ensure expedited implementation.</li>
<li>Feedback from stakeholders indicating anticipation for the redlined version and concerns about timeline constraints in the exemption criteria update process.</li>
<li>Discussions about potential conflicts and access issues regarding IEEE 2800 standards, suggesting the need for reconsideration of including specific guidelines internally.</li>
<li>Clarification of the PGRR109 timeline for ERCOT and TSP review of dynamic models with the intent to expedite processes for ride-through capability improvements.</li>
<li>Stakeholder concerns about the practicality and timeline for meeting new requirements, with assurances of efforts to facilitate and expedite the process within allowed regulations.</li>
</ul>
