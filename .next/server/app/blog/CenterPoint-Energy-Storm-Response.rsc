</ul>
</li>
<li>Jason Ryan on CenterPoint’s temporary emergency generation assets<ul>
<li>Jason Ryan provided context about the temporary emergency generation assets installed to mitigate risks post-Winter Storm Uri and subsequent legislation in 2021 and 2023.</li>
<li>Large units primarily address the risk of load shedding, which disproportionately affects residential and small commercial customers in Houston due to the presence of large industrial consumers.</li>
<li>Houston requires importing 60% of its power due to insufficient local generation; large units help mitigate risks posed by potential disruptions in transmission lines (e.g., due to natural disasters).</li>
<li>These assets are seen as tools for various risks, with the necessity of maintaining a diverse and adequate fleet to handle different scenarios.</li>
<li>CenterPoint commits to better transparency and communication about risk assessments and the size of their fleet through periodic filings and possibly independent assessments.</li>
<li>There is ongoing evaluation of the affordability of these assets, with discussions on extending recovery periods to lower customer bills and re-assessing the need for these assets as new energy fund generators come online.</li>
<li>Open to discussing whether CenterPoint should continue mitigating these risks or if these responsibilities should be relocated.</li>
<li>CenterPoint intends to file periodic updates and engage in further discussions about the assets and their associated costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jason Ryan on their filing under Project 56793<ul>
<li>Filed 250 pages of information in response to Miss Corona’s five questions.</li>
<li>Most of the information pertains to leases of assets, specifically 232 pages for question one including short term and long term leases.</li>
<li>Short term leases initiated in 2021 due to immediate needs during hurricane season and following Winter Storm Uri.</li>
<li>Long term leases extend to 2029 with various amendments to ensure asset availability and vendor compliance.</li>
<li>Smaller units leased following legislative amendments in 2023.</li>
<li>Details and responses about units used, costs, and performance are provided in spreadsheets starting on page 233.</li>
<li>No units owned by the company, all under lease as per law.</li>
<li>Information on mutual assistance units received during Hurricane Beryl provided (pages 241).</li>
<li>Incremental costs associated with unit usage during Hurricane Beryl are partially detailed, awaiting final invoices (page 243).</li>
<li>Narrative on deployment process of assets during Hurricane Beryl provided (pages 245-250), including operational hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eric Easton on CenterPoint’s circuit segmentation<ul>
<li>CenterPoint has made major changes in circuit segmentation and intelligent grid switching to improve load management.</li>
<li>During Winter Storm Uri, manual attempts to segment circuits were made but were hindered by road conditions.</li>
<li>Installation of intelligent grid switching devices has added approximately 400 MW of capacity for load rotation.</li>
<li>An upcoming circuit segmentation study for ERCOT aims to install around 40 more devices for further enhancement.</li>
<li>Current manual load rotation capability is about 3000 MW, leaving a 2000 MW deficit during Winter Storm Uri.</li>
<li>Post-Uri improvements include investments in distribution systems, weatherization, dual fuel capability, and overall winter reliability and resiliency.</li>
<li>There will be a re-analysis this year based on a new 19,000 MW benchmark.</li>
<li>Load ratio share changes yearly and large industrial loads may come on faster than before, adding uncertainty.</li>
<li>Calculations also consider factors like potential increases in wildfire risks, which could impact load shedding in the Houston area.</li>
<li>Ongoing evaluations are being made on the number of units needed and deployment speed, which may require process and staffing changes.</li>
<li>Past analyses will be provided to compare with current data to understand decision-making progress.</li>
<li>Evaluation criteria also include considerations for loss of major transmission lines into Houston in load shed analyses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commissioner Hjaltman’s question to CenterPoint on stackable generators<ul>
<li>Commissioner Hjaltman asks CenterPoint if purchased generators for load shed can be replaced with smaller stackable generators.</li>
<li>CenterPoint indicates that 5MW units can be paralleled at a substation.</li>
<li>Each 32MW unit is connected at its own substation and is ready for use in various scenarios.</li>
<li>Paralleling 1 MW units is not feasible due to physical space constraints at substations.</li>
<li>5 MW units are compared to tractor trailers, while 32MW units require cranes for assembly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commissioner Glotfelty’s question on canceling lease agreements<ul>
<li>Commissioner Glotfelty had questions about the termination clause in Amendment 5 of a lease agreement.</li>
<li>Two different financial consequences were noted: a potential $53 million payment and 25% of total cost ($125 million).</li>
<li>Clarification sought on the consequences of canceling the leases today.</li>
<li>Termination provision expired in March 2023 and extended till the end of 2023.</li>
<li>No live provision exists that allows termination based on the prudence determination; it was contingent on a commission determination not being appealed.</li>
<li>Only remaining termination option stems from vendor non-performance, which includes failure to provide 94% availability.</li>
<li>Commissioner Hjaltman inquired about the possibility of changing out various units for better performance.</li>
<li>It was confirmed that while the assets are tested and maintained for readiness, changing the assets requires mutual commercial agreement with the vendor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eric Easton on CenterPoint readying units<ul>
<li>Eric Easton described performance evaluations, including testing and deployment during Hurricane Beryl, affirming that proper procedures are in place for readiness.</li>
<li>Discussion on readying units which progressed to EEA level, addressing the potential need for load shed.</li>
<li>Confirmation that units were readied four times since the Uri event.</li>
<li>Consideration of future scenarios including Texas Energy Fund generation impacting asset management.</li>
<li>Acknowledgment of changes in load ratio share due to industrial and residential growth.</li>
<li>Impact of legislation on reliability and resiliency of grid infrastructure.</li>
<li>Request for a more transparent analysis of readiness and performance of units.</li>
<li>Need to assess practical and pragmatic ways forward given current lease contracts.</li>
<li>Concern about the cost and underutilization of mobile generation units.</li>
<li>Inquiry about market rate differences for SMT 60 generating units and specifics of the CNP contract.</li>
<li>Questions raised about the role and background of Goldfinch Energy in the contracts.</li>

</li>
<li><p>58 – Discussion and possible action regarding customer service issues, including but not limited to correspondence and complaint issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chairman Gleeson recalls discussion &amp; possible action regarding customer service issues<ul>
<li>Items 52 and 58 were recalled for further discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connie Corona speaks on customer complaints concerning CenterPoint<ul>
<li>Call volume and informal complaints doubled since Hurricane Beryl.</li>
<li>As of the close of business yesterday, there were 1320 complaints against CenterPoint.</li>
<li>65 complaints related to estimated meter reads while customers were not receiving service.</li>
<li>Customers’ usage recorded on days they had not yet been restored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connie Corona asks CenterPoint to explain the problem identification and resolution process.</li>
<li>Tony Gardner, CenterPoint’s SVP Chief Customer Officer on the estimated meter process<ul>
<li>Discussion on how the estimated meter process works.</li>
<li>If power is on and unable to communicate with the meter, data is estimated at a 15-minute interval level.</li>
<li>If power is off, usage is not estimated, and zeros are recorded for those intervals.</li>
<li>Transmittal of data involves sending information to ERCOT and retail electric providers.</li>
<li>In July, 2.9 million transmittals of meter usage data were sent.</li>
<li>96,000 of these contained some form of estimation.</li>
<li>74,000 meter reads showed a 30% lower usage compared to the prior year.</li>
<li>Received 1300 meter dispute requests from retail providers.</li>
<li>16 requests resulted in reversed and rebilled charges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connie Corona’s question for CenterPoint concerning the modification of their standard operating procedure<ul>
<li>There were anomalies in customer usage data where usage was higher than expected, even when customers were out of service.</li>
<li>CenterPoint uses a model that examines customer usage over the past three months to create exceptions and verify billing usage.</li>
<li>They are actively fine-tuning this model to improve its accuracy and address anomalies, especially those caused by storms.</li>
<li>Communication with customers about these issues was discussed, and representatives were asked how they handle customer interactions regarding unusual bills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christina Rollins, NRG’s Assistant General Counsel of Reg. Affairs on communication with customer<ul>
<li>Christina Rollins explained the process of TDUs sending usage data to reps/lses.</li>
<li>Customers can view their daily usage on the Smart Meter Texas (SMT) portal and via weekly summary emails.</li>
<li>During Hurricane Beryl, customers noticed usage data even when their power was out.</li>
<li>NRG contacted TDUs (notably Centerpoint) to resolve the issue; it took about a week, resolved by July 29.</li>
<li>An 867 transaction is used for monthly meter reads, and if estimates are used, it’s indicated on the bill.</li>
<li>NRG prepared call center agents to explain the usage discrepancy to customers and inform them they wouldn’t be charged for power outage periods.</li>
<li>Information about the issue was also updated on the online account maintenance portal and included in weekly summary emails.</li>
<li>During the crisis, call center wait times were less than a minute, with a peak call volume of 44,000 calls in one day.</li>
<li>Past instances of estimated meter readings during crises, such as Hurricane Uri, were also noted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commissioner Hjaltman’s question to CenterPoint &amp; NRG on communication with customers<ul>
<li>CenterPoint acknowledges the need for better customer education regarding Smart Meter Texas information.</li>
<li>Explained the delay in trueing up meter usage, which can take 2-5 days.</li>
<li>REPs and TDUs are working on preventive measures to ensure accurate invoicing.</li>
<li>Proposals to shorten the time between estimated reporting and outage recovery sequences..</li>
<li>Suggestion to report zeros during large-scale outages instead of estimating usage.</li>
<li>Emphasis on having frequent market calls to update about ongoing situations for better communication.</li>
<li>Commitment from REPs to assist in communication using their resources and call centers.</li>
<li>During past events like Hurricane Beryl, daily calls were hosted with REPs to update them on restoration efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connie Corona recaps discussion<ul>
<li>For the vast majority of customers, the problem was noticed when checking usage online.</li>
<li>By the time the monthly bill was calculated and sent out by the retail electric provider, the issue was fully resolved.</li>
<li>Customers with concerns about their bill should contact their retail electric provider.</li>
<li>Assistance is also available from the Consumer Protection Division.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Barksdale English, PUC’s Deputy Executive Director concerning reports due to the Legislature &amp; RFIs<ul>
<li>The Commission issued voluntary RFIs related to Hurricane Beryl recovery.</li>
<li>Reports for the Legislature are due at the beginning of December; responses are due at the end of the month.</li>
<li>Issued mandatory RFIs to about 90 utilities in the disaster-declared areas.</li>
<li>Approximately 10% of the utilities had outdated contact information; utilities are reminded to update their information.</li>
<li>RFIs were sent to 30 co-ops, 30 cities, 17 water utilities, and 9 telecommunications utilities.</li>
<li>Utilities should respond to RFIs with ‘does not apply’ if questions are irrelevant to their operations.</li>
<li>Utilities that did not receive direct communication from the Commission Staff are not required to respond.</li>
<li>Responses to mandatory RFIs are due on August 30 and will be filed publicly under Project No. 56822.</li>
<li>Any utility with questions or concerns about the RFIs should contact staff directly.</li>
<li>Utilities that received direct communication must respond to the RFIs even if their utility was not impacted.</li>

<ul>
<li>Items 43 and 44 called up together</li>
<li>Commission Staff’s David Smeltzer on communication &amp; outage trackers<ul>
<li>Focus on increasing and addressing communications and coordination issues from investigations.</li>
<li>Requirement for TDUs to have an online electricity power outage tracker.</li>
<li>Outage tracker essential for customers to get updates about power outages.</li>
<li>Interest in comments on additional features and functionalities for these trackers.</li>
<li>Addressing coordination issues where electric utilities may need to temporarily stop electric service for safety.</li>
<li>Coordination needed with state agencies such as Railroad Commission, State Fire Marshall, and Public Utility Commission.</li>
<li>Utilities to establish process to receive reliable information from state agencies to decide on power shutoff for addressing hazardous conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commission Staff’s David Smeltzer on emergency contact to TDUs by REPs<ul>
<li>Discussion of second rulemaking focused on individual customer communications during outages.</li>
<li>Frustrations noted from past events like Hurricane Beryl due to lack of reliable information for customers.</li>
<li>Proposal to change customer communication default from opt-in to opt-out.</li>
<li>Retail Electric Providers (REPs) will be required to share customer information with Transmission and Distribution Utilities (TDUs) for emergency contacts.</li>
<li>Emphasis on privacy and narrow use of customer information specifically for power outage status and restoration updates.</li>
<li>Request for comments from utilities and REPs, including descriptions of current communication capabilities.</li>
<li>Final objective is to adopt the best possible rule by ensuring all relevant facts are considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commissioner Cobos lays out her memo on 56897<ul>
<li>Commissioner Cobos presented her memo regarding Project No. 56897 related to the electric utility outage tracker.</li>
<li>Proposed two changes:<ul>
<li>Outage tracker should provide information in both English and Spanish where applicable.</li>
<li>Utility must immediately notify the commission if the outage tracker goes offline unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These changes aim to enhance communication with the public and ensure the commission is aware of any outage tracker issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commission Staff agrees with these recommendations and praised their thoughtfulness.<ul>
<li>Staff advises publishing the rules as filed but with the added concepts incorporated into the draft.</li>
<li>Suggested asking utilities to provide links to their current outage trackers for easier access and review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commissioner Cobos lays out her memo on Project 56898<ul>
<li>Commissioner Cobos recommends amending the proposal to require TDUs to provide affected customers with power outage information, estimated restoration times, and updates in both English and Spanish.</li>
<li>Flexibility is suggested for coordination between representatives (Reps) and TDUs to determine best practices for this bilingual communication.</li>
<li>Consumers often have a preferred language for communications, which should be respected.</li>
<li>Existing consumer protection rules already require Reps to communicate in the language in which the customer was enrolled.</li>
<li>Feedback is sought from retailers and customers on whether this bilingual practice should be extended.</li>
<li>Comments are welcome on the logistical capabilities of TDUs to implement this change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Motion to approve proposal for publication<ul>
<li>The motion to approve the proposal for publication with the identification number 56897 prevails.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Motion to approve proposal for publication<ul>
<li>Motion to approve proposals for publication in Project No. 56897 and 56898.</li>
<li>Motion made consistent with Commissioner Cobos memos and the discussion.</li>
<li>Motion carried unanimously.</li>
