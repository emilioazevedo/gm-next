<h2>2 – HB2555, relating to transmission and distribution system resiliency planning by and cost recovery for electric utilities</h2>
<p><strong>Connie Corona</strong> – PUCT – <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a></p>
<p>Connie Corona, Executive Director of the <strong>PUC</strong>, is testifying neutrally.
<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a> establishes procedures for utilities to submit plans to strengthen <strong>transmission and distribution systems’ resiliency</strong>.
The Commission has 180 days to review, approve, modify, or deny the plans.
The rule governing the submission and approval process took effect in February.
Plans must demonstrate clear benefits to customers and strengthen systems against <strong>resiliency events</strong> like hurricanes.
Three <strong>resiliency plans</strong> have already been filed by CenterPoint, Oncor, and Entergy.
Filings are contested cases involving numerous intervenors including <strong>ERCOT</strong>, cities, and customer groups.
These plans are complex, often up to 1000 pages.
Commission Staff will recommend approval of plan elements that provide clear protection for Texans.
Plans must be decided upon within 180 days of filing.
CenterPoint’s plan is currently paused for reevaluation.
An update on CenterPoint’s plan will be provided in the fall.
Updates on Representative Metcalf’s letter regarding the Entergy case will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Woody Rickerson</strong> – ERCOT – <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a></p>
<p>Woody Rickerson from <strong>ERCOT</strong>, testifying neutrally, explained that <strong>ERCOT’s</strong> role is to review <strong>resiliency plans</strong> from a transmission perspective and provide coordination if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Ekoh</strong> – OPUC – <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a></p>
<p>The review of <strong>resiliency plans</strong> focuses on the effectiveness of proposed measures to mitigate weather or security-related emergencies.
There is no initial review process to assess prudence at the beginning stages of plan review.
Customers bear the cost of the plans, regardless of whether they fail or succeed in mitigating the intended issue.
A legislative fix is needed to allow cities or municipalities to review the prudence of these plans before implementation.
High costs are involved in developing and implementing these <strong>resiliency measures</strong>.
Current inability to assess whether the costs are justified or necessary before they are included in rates.
Consumer benefits from these plans and accountability mechanisms for utilities are crucial aspects of the review.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Bell</strong> – AECT – <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a></p>
<p>Mark Bell, President of <strong>AECT</strong>, testified neutrally.
Electric utilities in Texas are facing unprecedented challenges due to rapid growth and extreme weather events.
<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a>, the <strong>Texas Resiliency Act</strong>, was introduced to help utilities develop and implement long-term <strong>resiliency plans</strong>.
The Act was modeled after similar legislation in Florida and allows for investments in projects to improve <strong>grid resiliency</strong>.
These projects include strengthening distribution facilities, undergrounding lines, lightning and flood mitigation, cybersecurity, vegetation management, and wildlife response.
<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2555">HB2555</a> aims to reduce costs and improve long-term infrastructure, benefiting consumers by potentially avoiding repetitive storm recovery costs.
Utilities submit multi-year <strong>resiliency plans</strong> to the <strong>PUC</strong> for review and approval.
Discussion on the transmission portion of the bill, which was removed in the final version, and potential utility in revisiting it later.
Emphasis on the importance of the <strong>resiliency measures</strong> and ongoing support from <strong>PUC</strong> in reviewing submitted plans.</p>
